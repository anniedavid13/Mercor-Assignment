# Mercor-Assignment
This project is an assignment to demonstrate my ability to build animations and sophisticated components in React. The goal is to clone two sections from the website https://chroniclehq.com/ and deploy them as section 1 and section 2 of a website. The primary focus of assessment will be on the functionality of the deployed site.
## Instructions

## Clone Section 1: Dark Grey Text Animation

In this section, I have cloned the dark grey text animation that turns white when scrolling. I have carefully followed the exact formatting and animation as found on the provided website. The animation seamlessly fills the dark grey text with white as the user scrolls down the page.

## Clone Section 2: Fancy Scrolling Animations

For the second section, I have cloned the fancy scrolling animations located on the right side of the page. I have replicated the exact formatting and animations as seen on the source website. The scrolling animations provide an engaging and visually appealing experience for the users.


## Deployment
I have deployed the cloned sections as a website. You can access it using the following link: https://annie-david-mercor-assignment.netlify.app/
